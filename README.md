# CS213-P3-Photos
# Source assignment: https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/213/classes/spring_2024_venugopal/photos/photos.html
# To Nicole: If you've already pull the older version of the branch to make changes, please pull again to use the new branch structure, Photos13/src/photos13/data,docs,Photos13.java
# Knew that for final submission we have to let docs and data folder directly under Photos13 folder, but for now convienient only does this change
