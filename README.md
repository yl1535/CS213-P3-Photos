# CS213-P3-Photos
* This is a simple photo viewer with distinct album, tags, and user functionalities.
* Note: As this project is not packaged to an exe program, different types of compiling ways may not all success due to their different ways of choosing compiler paths. While facing compiling issues, please find Photos13/Photos.java, and change the path in line 26 to the right path your compiler can reach Photos13UI.fxml.
* The program provides an admin account to manage user accounts, which can be login using username "admin". The program also provides a basic stock account with username "stock", which carries some stock pictures for test uses. The location of those stock pictures are in /Photos13/data, and will be automatically loaded into the stock account during initialization, if there doesn't exist any saved data for running this program. If loading fails, please follow the same step above to manually fix the paths in /Photos13/Admin.java from line 173 to line 177.
* This program will automatically record your operation results and load them the next time you start it, regardless of whether it is closed properly or not.
* For any operational issues using this program, please refer to the DemoVideo carried with this project.
